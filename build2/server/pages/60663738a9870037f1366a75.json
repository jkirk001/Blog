In our case, as web developers, it is a sorting algorithm often used for its simplicity and speed when working with small or partially ordered datasets. So a blog page with 100 or so posts that are stored in a quasi ordered manner ( maybe its stored in month based clusters or your DB partially orders by ID — this is a big if, as data may seem ordered initially but it WILL NOT remain consistent in most DBs )."},{"type":"sub","content":"What is insertion sort not great for?"},{"type":"p","content":"Insertion sort is not great for large random datasets. If you have a large RESTful collection of data, that may be added to, removed from or modified at any time, insertion sort is one of the slowest sorting algorithms you can choose.

But the info is likely still valuable."},{"type":"sub","content":"How does insertion sort work?"},{"type":"p","content":"Insertion sort works by finding a pivot point, in the case of insertion sort usually the first or last element in the array, then comparing each item to it and moving that item to the correct side of it.\n"},{"type":"p","content":"As we move down ( or up) the array, a trail of ordered elements is left in the wake.

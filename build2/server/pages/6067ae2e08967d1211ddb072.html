Its not something I ever really considered until dark-themes started to become a more standard option. Before the great migration to JS frameworks color schemes were still important, and making accessible websites — which included finding color schemes that don’t stress the eyes beyond a point, yet are easily readable for people with poor eyesight or chromatic deficiencies — was a priority for quality developers. But now with the prevalence of user selected color schemes, it has become easier than ever to mis-optimize color schemes. </p><p>Now I’m not saying this is some great issue that is overlooked by large websites. Large production websites tend to take this into account when designing. But for small independent developers like me, it’s just another small step that can be easily overlooked when compared to business logic or UX fluidity. </p><h2>So what should I look for?</h2><p>The safest choice is to measure the contrast ratio of the colors being used. This way, even if the user can only see the monochromatic scale all text will be visible.  The WCAG 2.0 standard recommends a level of 4.5:1 for regular sized text and 3:1 for large text (14px bold -18px and up).</p><p>There are a few nice resources available for this : </p><p>https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</p><p>https://marijohannessen.github.io/color-contrast-checker/</p><h2>Is that really the only consideration?</h2><p>No. Thats the main accessibility issue, but one thing some developers ignore is the contrast should also be kept for being too high. When the contrast is extreme, like black text on a white background, or white text on a black background, the user has to strain their eyes to read it. </p><p>I’m no biologist but I know we have all experienced it. You open a website to read an article in bed at night and were greeted with a shining white display that makes your room visible from space so you switch to dark mode, and boom it’s suddenly much easier to read in the dark. Thats because our eyes are only so good at registering extreme differences in contrast. </p><p>The same applies to lettering and backgrounds. </p><p>Having a white font on a black background forces our eyes to strain more than they need to. </p><h2>FInal Considerations </h2><p>Rather than use hyper contrasting colors, go for muted versions of what you were intending.
